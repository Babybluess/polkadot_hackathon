# Introduction

IISharkBluess is a lending token dApp in multichain, Ethereum and Moonbeam network.

# Problem
• Traditional lenders already have collateral to insure their investments, this has not been true with cryptocurrencies from the start.

• Traditionally, the process of bringing borrowers and lenders together was facilitated by financial institutions such as banks or peer-to-peer lenders, who controlled access along with interest, loan rate. In traditional financial markets, the short-term borrowing and lending market is called the money market

• For those who own crypto, crypto has not yet created liquidity so it does not have value as a valuation object, those assets cannot be traded and make a profit. For the crypto market in general, people's access to crypto is still limited and not yet popular.

• Current dApp applications can almost only be used on a certain Blockchain network and it is also quite rare that dApps support the moombeam network.

# Solution

• A cryptocurrency loan system based on blockchain technology will help minimize risks for lenders when borrowers want to receive cryptocurrency loans

• This system provides many important features such as: Borrow crypto by pledging other crypto, create crypto loan requests, create lending offer to make profit in multichain that is ethereum and moonbeam network.
